# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network lisk-sepolia
npx hardhat verify --network lisk-sepolia 0x2531c55dE5AcF27c23bb0A1eE71094AcCb1426c8

0x2531c55dE5AcF27c23bb0A1eE71094AcCb1426c8 first deployed contract 
0x90a70d1e10990a7C2888D6a768Ef50ABBDa26611 second deployed contract
```
